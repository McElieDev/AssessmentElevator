//Console App Name:         ELEVATOR CHALLENGE
//Full App Requirement: create a console application in C# using OOP principles that simulates the movement of elevators, with the goal being to move people as efficiently as possible.
// The console application should provide the following features:
// > show the status of the elevators, including which floor they are on, whether they are moving and in which direction, and how many people they are carrying
// > provides a way to interact with the elevators, including calling them to a specific floor and setting the number of people waiting on each floor
//The console application should be able to offer the following:
// ■ support for multiple floors
// ■ support for multiple elevators
//Hints
// Given a pool of elevators, the program should send the nearest available elevator to that person.
//Extra Credit
//For extra credit, allow a weight limit, expressed as a number of people, to be imposed on the elevators. You can assume every elevator in the simulation has the same weight limit.
